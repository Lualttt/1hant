# 1hant
1hant (one hand) is an [artsey.io](https://artsey.io) + [graphite](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout) inspired one handed keyboard layout

the name 1hant comes from obviously one + hand with the mispelling on purpose since you need a chord for the letter d and not for the letter t :P

it is meant as an easy to use layout trying to minimalize effort pressing on the keys hence most keys are a chord with 2 keys

the bottom row is the home row

### Todo:
- [x] make backspace, enter, space and layer switches global chords
- [x] typing test like [monkey type](https://monkeytype.com)
- [ ] add wpm stat to the typing test
- [ ] keybinding menu
- [x] right hand support
- [x] punctuation & numbers
- [x] add remaining special characters
- [x] add modifier layout [#5](https://github.com/LualtOfficial/1hant/issues/5)
- [x] holding down a chord doesnt repeat the chord
- [ ] make it pretty âœ¨

### Layout:
```
this only shows the left handed layout to use this
with the right hand flip everything horizontally
